	// generalCardType: the type of card to generate - if left blank, assumes it's Monster (not recommended)
	// - Valid values per deck listed here:
	// - Main Deck: Monster, Spell, Trap, RandomMain
	// - Extra Deck: Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, Link, RandomExtra
	//
	// levelRange: the range of monster levels to include - ignored for all other cards
	//
	// cardRange: the number of cards to include
	//
	// namePattern: 
	// - type:
	//   - Round Robin: Goes through each name one time in a cycle, then loops back to the first one
	//   - Fallback: Goes through each name until all cards are exhausted
	// - patterns: An array of name patterns - only includes cards that match the pattern (any string, case insensitive, with * as wildcard)
	//   - For instance, "man*" would match any card starting with "man"; "*cat*" would match any card containing "cat"
	// - matchWholeWord: If set to true, then each pattern will check that the word is contained as its own word
	//   - This will NOT replace wild characters - do not include them in the string!
	//   - e.g. "Pot" will match "Pot of Greed" but not "Potion"
	// - shufflePatterns: Shuffle the patterns so that they're chosen in a random order rather than the listed order
	//   - Useful if you don't want it to be predictable
	//   - For Round Robin, it's shuffled again once the end of the list of reached, so you won't know which dups you might
	//     get, should it do more than one loop around
	//
	// - for instance, "man*" would match any card starting with "man"; "*cat*" would match any card containing "cat"
	//
	// allowLevel0IfNotInRange: if there is a level range, whether to include level 0 cards in the results
	// - for instance, Link monsters would be included since they don't have a level
	// - this is off by default
	//
	// excludedGeneralTypes: used ONLY with the two Random generalCardTypes 
	// - excludes the listed generalCardTypes in the list when choosing random cards
