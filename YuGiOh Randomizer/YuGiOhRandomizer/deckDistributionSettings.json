	// How to configure decks:
	// -----------------------
	// Deck settings - this controls which deck is generated for the player/opponent. Set either value to
	// null if you do not wish to generate a deck for them. Set either value to whatever key value you've created
	// in the DeckDistributionSettingsMap to point their deck at those settings.
	// > PlayerDeck: The set of settings to use. If not found, or null, it will NOT generate a player deck.
	// > OpponentDeck: The set of settings to use. If not found, or null, it will NOT generate an opponent deck.
	//
	// >> DeckCreationSettingsMap: Key-value pairs from deck name to their settings, explained here
	//
	// > mainDeckSize: A range of possible deck sizes - hard limits from 40-60: { "min": #, "max": # }
	// > mainDeckSize: A range of possible deck sizes - hard limits from 0-15: { "min": #, "max": # }

	// Whether to add random cards to the appropriate deck if all tasks are complete but the deck size is not reached yet
	// If this is off for the player deck, it means that it cannot be used, should the deck have less than 40 cards!
	// Note that the game does actually let the opponent use a deck with less than 40 cards.
	// > mainDeckAddRandomCardsIfNeeded: true or false
	// > extraDeckAddRandomCardsIfNeeded: true or false
	//
	// > ignoreBanList: Ignore the ban list completely - allows 3 of every card (true or false)
	//
	//
	// >> deckCreationTasks (an array of the following object):
	//
	// The following properties are for defining deck creation tasks. They're gone through one-by-one until either
	// the deck size is reached, or there's no more tasks. At the end, if the deck size isn't reached, it will add
	// random cards to the deck, depending on the setting.
	// 
	// > generalCardType: the type of card to generate - if left blank, assumes it's Monster (not recommended)
	// - Valid values per deck listed here:
	// - Main Deck: Monster, Spell, Trap, RandomMain
	// - Extra Deck: Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, Link, RandomExtra
	//
	// > cardRange: the number of cards to include (ALL RANGES are an object with a min and a max value)
	//
	// > mainFilter: The main filter that will be ran through for the entire deck
	//   - see the "filters" object below for the allowed properties
	//
	// > filterSet: 
	//  - Consists of three values:
	//    > type:
	//     - Round Robin (default): Goes through each name one time in a cycle, then loops back to the first one
	//     - Fallback: Goes through each name until all cards are exhausted
	//  - mainFilter: A single main filter that will be ran through once, and which all future filters will be based on
	//  - filters: The array of filters that will be ran through, which the types listed above run against.
	//    > See below for documentation on filling out the filters (main and filters use the same object)
	//
	// > filters: an array of objects with the following properties - doesn't use them if left blank
	//   > generalCardType: same as above - can be used to specify a specific type if the main type is RandomMain, for instance
	//   > excludedGeneralTypes: excludes the listed generalCardTypes in the list when choosing random cards
	//   > name: only includes cards that match the pattern (any string, case insensitive, with * as wildcard)
	//    - For instance, "man*" would match any card starting with "man"; "*cat*" would match any card containing "cat"
	//   > nameFilterType: enter one of these as a string:
	//    - Wildcard (default): treats * as wildcards, meaning "one or more of any character"
	//    - MatchWholeWord: checks the entry against all words in the card for an exact match
	//                       a "word" is anything separated by a non-alphabetical character
	//    - Regex: treats the entry as a regular expression, matching against the entire name
	//    - RegexAnyWord: treats the entry as a regular expression, matching against each word individually
	//                    is a match if any one of the words match
	//   > generalCardTypes: an array of allowed general card types - Monster, Spell, Trap
	//     - DO NOT use RandomMain and RandomExtra at this level!
	//   > cardTypes: The types of cards to include (TODO: document the exact values)
	//   > isPendulum: Whether the card is a pendulum card
	//   > isTuner: Whether the card is a tuner card
	//   > isNormal: Whether the card is a normal monster (Normal Monster, Normal Tuner Monster, and Pendulum Normal Monster) 
	//   > levelRange: { min: #, max: #} - the range of levels allowed
	//   > allowLevel0IfNotInRange: if there is a level range, whether to include level 0 cards in the results
	//			- for instance, Link monsters would be included since they don't have a level
	//			- this is off by default
	//   > archetypes: an array of allowed archetypes
	//   > types: an array of allowed types (TODO: document these, they are the "race" value)
	//   > attributes: an array of allowed attributes (TODO: document these)
	//   > attackRange: { min: #, max: #} - the range of attack points allowed
	//   > defenseRange: { min: #, max: #} - the range of defense points allowed
	//
	// > shuffleFilters: Shuffle the filters so that they're chosen in a random order rather than the listed order
	//    - Useful if you don't want it to be predictable
	//    - For Round Robin, it's shuffled again once the end of the list of reached, so you won't know which dups you might
	//      get, should it do more than one loop around
